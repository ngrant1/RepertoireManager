Maestro - Repertoire Managing System 

### Problem Statement
Problem - 
Orchestral musicians don't have orchestral feedback and resources while practicing alone. 

Maestro will...
Enhance musical comprehension and collaboration in orchestral musicians by providing a social repertoire managing platform. Maestro will allow members to scan and upload their edited score to their orchestral group. The conductor approved scores become accessible to other members. This streamlines collaboration for more uniform sections. Members can also browse categorized music archives and store them in a personalized account. These dynamic archives contain tabs of rescources which aid comprehension, such as audio, video, scales, and terminology descriptions. Members will be updated on meeting times, concert dates, and other orchestra related events through the group calendar in addition to a messaging system. 

Other: 
  * Concert calendar..or purchase tickets info..?

  * News feeds of orchestras?
